# Heart-Disease-Detection
The heart disease detection project aims to build a tool that will help users detect the presence of heart disease. It uses Python and the supervised learning classification technique to accurately predict the presence of a heart disease based on different medical factors.
Learning outcomes: 

Knowledge of machine learning basics: Understanding how the entire machine learning process works
Data manipulation and analysis: Learn the use of Python libraries Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis, data cleaning, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers 
Data visualization: Use of Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization 
Data preprocessing: Understanding of data clearing and handling missing values, feature engineering techniques, data scaling and normalization, and dealing with categorical variables 
Supervised learning model selection and evaluation: Use of appropriate supervised learning algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests 
Evaluating model performance: Knowledge of different model performance evaluation metrics
What it takes to execute this project:

Download and install Python and its necessary libraries on your system 
Obtain the required data from websites using web scraping 
Preprocessing of data by cleaning data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables 
Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to understand the relationship between different features and target variables to identify the presence of a heart disease 
Split the data into two parts, one for training the model and the other for testing the model’s performance 
Select an appropriate supervised learning algorithm, train it with the data, and optimize its performance 
Evaluate the performance of the model using the testing data; if it’s not up to the mark, use different feature engineering techniques to improve results 
Real world applications: 

Doctors can use the tool to detect any hidden heart diseases in a patient during emergencies 
Patients can use it for personal use to detect any heart disease early and take immediate actions
Hospitals can integrate the tool with their clinical decision support system to help doctors and nurses quickly assess patient’s risk of heart disease based on their medical data
